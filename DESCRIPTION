Description: The provided package implements the statistical tests for the functional repeated measures analysis problem (Kurylo and Smaga, 2023, <arXiv:2306.03883>). These procedures enable us to verify the overall hypothesis regarding equality, as well as hypotheses for pairwise comparisons (i.e., post hoc analysis) of mean functions corresponding to repeated experiments.
